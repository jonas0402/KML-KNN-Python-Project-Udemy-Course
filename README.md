# KML-KNN-Python-Project-Udemy-Course
This is another project with python using K- Nearest neighbor to predict a "Target Class". There is no understanding of the dataset but the key of KNN is to use the features, scaled them and predict the target based on the K value given and the proximity between data points. I used sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler) to transform and scale the data points and also I used the sklearn.neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier) to fit the the features with the K value given. However, I also created a function that ran K values from 1 to 40 to check the K values producing lower error rates. Then, I re-ran the model with a K value with a lower error rate.
